## R Markdown Snowflake Demo

This repo illustrates how to add illustrated snowflakes to R Markdown with a child document. (I do not cover when or why -- that's up to you.) 

Check out an example [here](https://emilyriederer.github.io/demo-rmd-snow/).

Essentially, this is simply done by reading in a child document that contains custom CSS and HTML. The heavy lifting is done by the CSS which I did **not** write -- it comes from [this CodePen].
